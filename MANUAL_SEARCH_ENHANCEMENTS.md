# Enhanced Manual Search API - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview
The manual search API has been significantly enhanced to provide comprehensive keyword matching, improved scoring, and better candidate prioritization based on field matches.

## üöÄ Key Enhancements

### 1. **Comprehensive Keyword Matching**
- **Before**: Limited matching logic
- **After**: Searches for ALL keywords in each field
- **Benefit**: If you search for "Software Engineer" and "Python Developer", it finds candidates matching either or both titles

### 2. **Enhanced Query Building**
- **Before**: Basic OR logic with patterns
- **After**: Individual keyword-based search for each field type
- **Benefit**: More comprehensive candidate discovery

### 3. **Improved Scoring System**
- **Experience Titles**: 20 points per match (increased from 15)
- **Skills**: 15 points per match (increased from 12) 
- **Education**: 3-18 points based on level (increased multiplier)
- **Experience Range**: 12 points exact match, 6 points close match
- **Location**: 10 points (current), 8 points (preference)
- **Salary**: 10 points for range match
- **Field Match Bonus**: 25 points per different field type matched

### 4. **Advanced Prioritization**
- **Primary Sort**: Number of different field types matched
- **Secondary Sort**: Total match score (base + bonus)
- **Tertiary Sort**: Total individual matches
- **Result**: Candidates matching more field types appear first

### 5. **Enhanced Match Details**
Each candidate now includes:
```json
{
  "match_score": 128.5,
  "base_score": 103.5,
  "field_match_bonus": 25,
  "match_details": {
    "fields_matched": 5,
    "matched_experience_titles": ["Software Engineer"],
    "matched_skills": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
    "matched_education": ["BTech"],
    "matched_locations": ["Mumbai (current)", "Mumbai (preference)"],
    "experience_range_match": true,
    "salary_range_match": true
  },
  "total_individual_matches": 9
}
```

### 6. **Limit Parameter**
- **Status**: Already optional (default=None)
- **Behavior**: When not provided, returns all matching candidates
- **When provided**: Limits results to specified number

## üéØ Request Body Example
Your provided request body works perfectly:
```json
{
  "experience_titles": ["Software Engineer", "Python Developer"],
  "skills": ["Python", "React", "AWS"],
  "min_education": ["BTech", "BSc"],
  "min_experience": "2 years 6 months",
  "max_experience": "5 years",
  "locations": ["Mumbai", "Pune", "Bangalore"],
  "min_salary": 500000,
  "max_salary": 1500000,
  "limit": 10
}
```

## üìä How Candidates Are Ranked

### Example Scenario:
**Candidate A**: Matches 4 field types (experience, skills, education, location)
**Candidate B**: Matches 2 field types (skills, salary) but has higher individual scores

**Result**: Candidate A appears first because they match more field types

### Scoring Breakdown:
1. **Field Diversity Bonus**: 25 points √ó number of field types matched
2. **Individual Match Points**: Based on specific matches within each field
3. **Total Score**: Base score + field diversity bonus

## üîç Search Behavior

### ALL Keyword Matching:
- **Experience Titles**: Finds candidates with ANY of the provided titles
- **Skills**: Finds candidates with ANY of the provided skills (checks both 'skills' and 'may_also_known_skills')
- **Education**: Finds candidates with ANY of the provided education levels
- **Locations**: Finds candidates in ANY of the provided locations

### Comprehensive Results:
- Returns candidates matching ANY criteria (comprehensive search)
- Prioritizes candidates matching MORE field types
- Shows exactly which keywords matched for transparency

## üß™ Testing
A test script (`test_manual_search.py`) has been created to verify:
1. Full request body functionality
2. Optional limit parameter
3. Enhanced match details
4. Proper candidate ranking

## üìà Benefits
1. **Better Candidate Discovery**: Finds ALL relevant candidates
2. **Improved Ranking**: Prioritizes candidates matching more criteria
3. **Transparency**: Shows exactly what matched
4. **Flexibility**: All parameters remain optional
5. **Comprehensive Scoring**: Rewards candidates matching multiple field types

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Next Steps
1. Test the API with your request body
2. Verify the enhanced match details
3. Check that candidates are properly ranked by field matches
4. Confirm the limit parameter works as expected

The API now provides exactly what you requested: comprehensive keyword matching with proper prioritization based on the number of fields matched, showing the most relevant candidates first.
